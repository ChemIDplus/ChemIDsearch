<p>
On the <span class="page-name">Create an Expression</span> page, after you start typing a value, the AutoComplete results appear.
</p>

<p>
Once you have entered 3 or more characters in the search term, the application displays a list of values that start with the entered search term.
By default, up to 20 rows of matching values are displayed.
If there are more than 20 matching values, then some values are grouped together.
</p>

<p>
To change the maximum number of AutoComplete rows your browser will display, click on the <span class="top-menu-button">Settings</span> button above.
Then adjust the appropriate field on the <span class="page-name">Settings</span> page.
You can set the value within a range from 10 to 50.
</p>

<p>
A search on "<span class="field">(automatic)</span> <span class="operator">(automatic)</span> ASPI" displays results including:
</p>
<ul class="dense">
	<li>Aspiculamycin</li>
	<li>Aspidelaps scutatus venom</li>
	<li>ASPIDIN* (6 values)</li>
	<li>&hellip;</li>
	<li>ASPIRIN* (117 values)</li>
	<li>Aspisol</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the example results above, the first, second, and last results are complete individual values that start with the search term.
Clicking on any one of the individual matching values completes the expression and displays the <span class="page-name">Expression matches ...</span> page.
</p>

<p>
The other two rows in the sample above are grouped values.
Grouped values represent multiple values that have text in common.
The displayed text is in all caps and includes all the starting characters that each group member has in common.
The shared letters are followed by an asterisk to indicate the "starts with" nature.
The grouped values row ends with the number of values in the group displayed within parantheses.
</p>

<p>
Clicking on a grouped values row updates the search term to the shared text, and populates the AutoComplete results with the appropriate matching values.
Alternatively, just continuing to type more letters of the search term will do the same.
Once the desired term is displayed, clicking on it will complete the expression and display the <span class="page-name">Expression matches ...</span> page.
</p>

<p>
Note that you may always click the <span class="go-button">Done</span> button without selecting a particular matching value.
All matching values will then match the search.
You may also click the <span class="go-button">Done</span> button when no AutoComplete results are showing, such as after entering only two characters in the search term, or when the selcted field or operator do not support the AutoComplete functionality.
</p>

<div>If a search:
	<ol>
		<li>Uses the <span class="field">(automatic)</span> or <span class="field">Name</span> field, and</li>
		<li>Uses the <span class="operator">(automatic)</span> or <span class="operator">starts with</span> operator, and</li>
		<li>Does not find any matches</li>
	</ol>
	Then the spell check results are displayed instead.
	For example, a search on "TNTT" will not find a match and will instead return spelling alternatives.
	The same search on "TNT" will find matching values and return them.
</div>
