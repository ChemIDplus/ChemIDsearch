<p>
The <span class="field">Category</span> field searches on categories / classification codes.
Some sources for our categories use plural terms, while others use singular terms.
To return the greatest amount of relevant matches, the search process ignores spaces, punctuation, and any "s" at the end of words.
Therefore the matching substances returned may not have the exact same spelling as a search term, but may have a similar category name instead.

Due to this merging and in order to generate quick AutoComplete results, the indicated value and substance totals for <span class="field">Category</span> searches may not be accurate in the AutoComplete.
Once a full search is run, the totals are correct.
