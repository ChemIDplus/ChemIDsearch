<p>
After generating a single expression, the application displays the <span class="page-name">Expression matches ...</span> page.
Instead of immediately running the search, another option is to create one or more additional expressions.
</p>

<p>
You can click on the <span class="modify-search-button">Add another</span> button to create a second expression.
On completing the second expression, the expressions list page title will update to <span class="page-name">Expressions match ...</span> with new totals.
The two expressions are ANDed together, such that all matching substance fulfill both expressions.
</p>

<p>
Any number of additional expressions can be added to the search and all will be true for any matching results.
</p>

<p>
Whenever there is more than one expression, you also have the option to mark the &quot;Not&quot; checkbox for some of your expressions.
For a valid search, at least one expression must not have &quot;Not&quot; checked.
</p>

<p>
For example, to search for all analgesics, you would use one expression:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="field">Category</span> <span class="operator">equals</span> Analgesics</li>
</ul>

<p>
Whereas, to search for all analgesics within the Drug Information Portal, you would use two expressions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="field">Category</span> <span class="operator">equals</span> Analgesics</li>
	<li><span class="field">Locator</span> <span class="operator">equals</span> DrugPortal</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you instead wanted to find all analgesics not within the Drug Information Portal, you would check the &quot;Not&quot; box on that expression:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="field">Category</span> <span class="operator">equals</span> Analgesics</li>
	<li>NOT <span class="field">Locator</span> <span class="operator">equals</span> DrugPortal</li>
</ul>
