<p>
The <span class="operator">in list</span> operator combines its terms with OR logic.
The search returns all substances that exactly match any of the terms.
Multiple search terms are each separated by the &quot;|&quot; (pipe) character.
</p>

<p>
Inserting a pipe character into the "Search Term(s)" input box will update the expression to use the <span class="operator">in list</span> operator.
</p>

<p>
When the <span class="operator">in list</span> operator is selected, clicking on an AutoComplete result will append the selected term to the "Search Term(s)" list and append another pipe character.
Only the characters in the final term are used to generate the AutoComplete results, and only these characters are replaced when selecting an AutoComplete result.
All prior terms are ignored and left unchanged when generating and using the AutoComplete results.
</p>

<p>
At least two terms are required for a valid <span class="operator">in list</span> expression.
When accessing the API via a link or address in a browser window (a GET request), the maximum number of terms is only limited by the maximum number of characters in the complete URL.
Typically this is around 4,000 characters total.
</p>

<p>
Asterisks serving as wildcards may not be used with the <span class="operator">in list</span> operator.
Only exact matches will return results.
