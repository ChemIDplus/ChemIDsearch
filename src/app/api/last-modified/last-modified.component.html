<p>
If you use the API and store results, the <span class="field">Last Modified</span> field allows you to only fetch incremental changes.
You can use it with the following operators:
</p>
<ul class="dense">
	<li><span class="operator">&gt;= (gte)</span></li>
	<li><span class="operator">&lt;= (lte)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
The search value must be one of the following formats:
</p>
<ul class="dense">
	<li>YYYYMMDD</li>
	<li>YYYY-MM-DD</li>
	<li>YYYY-MM (evaluated as YYYY-MM-01)</li>
	<li>YYYY (evaluated as YYYY-01-01)</li>
	<li>13 digit milliseconds (the last 3 digits need to exist but their values are ignored)</li>
</ul>

<p>
To only fetch data for records that have been modified since your last retrieval:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>After running an API search, store the highest lastMod property value from the results.</li>
	<li>Later, rerun the search with an additional expression: <span class="field">Last Modified</span> <span class="operator">&gt;=</span> [the highest lastMod value + 1000].</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that this method will find new matches or updated records that still match.
It does not return records that no longer match.
If you wish to keep your data in sync with ours and remove records that no longer match, more complicated logic would be required.
One option would be to check the current lastMod date for all records that previously matched.
Any with a current lastMod value higher than your new search value but which were not returned by the new search must no longer match.
