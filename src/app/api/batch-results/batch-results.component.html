<p>
If an API search matches many substances or you request a lot of data for each one (e.g. using data=complete), then the API will only return a subset of the results.
If your result includes <i>start</i> and <i>end</i>, then the server has only sent a single batch back.
To get data for all of the matching substances, you need to make multiple requests and include the batchStart parameter.
</p>

<p>
For example, let us examine a search on "RN starts with 50-", requesting all ChemID<i>plus</i> data for every record.
The abbreviated URL for that search is: <a href="https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/api/data/rn/sw/50-?data=complete" target="_blank">https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/api/data/rn/sw/50-?data=complete</a> which returns:
</p>
<pre>
{{ '{' }}
	"total": 80,
	"start": 1,
	"end": 25,
	"results": [
		...
	]
}
</pre>

<p>
We see <i>total</i>, which means that the search matched 80 substances.
But we also see <i>start</i> and <i>end</i>, which means that the result only included data for the first 25 of the 80 matching substances.
To get the rest, we would need to make additional requests, each one incrementing the batchStart parameter to be one more than the prior <i>end</i> value:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/api/data/rn/sw/50-?data=complete&batchStart=26" target="_blank">https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/api/data/rn/sw/50-?data=complete&amp;batchStart=26</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/api/data/rn/sw/50-?data=complete&batchStart=51" target="_blank">https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/api/data/rn/sw/50-?data=complete&amp;batchStart=51</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/api/data/rn/sw/50-?data=complete&batchStart=76" target="_blank">https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/api/data/rn/sw/50-?data=complete&amp;batchStart=76</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The data parameter lets you specify what fields you want to receive data for.
As all batches are about the same file size, more data per substance means fewer substances per batch.
Depending on the data parameter you choose, batch sizes range from 25 to 25,000 substances per batch.
Choosing the most focused data parameter for your needs allows you to fetch more substances at once, so you would need fewer batches and have less data to parse.
</p>

<p>
<b>Please request batches one at a time, waiting for one to complete before requesting the next batch.</b>
That way our servers will not be overwhelmed and everyone can receive data in a timely fashion.
