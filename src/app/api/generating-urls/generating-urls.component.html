<p>
There are 2 user interfaces to help you learn to build valid ChemID<i>plus</i> API Search URLs: this application and the Swagger UI.
We expect this ChemID<i>plus</i> API Search application will be more useful for most users, especially for building multi-expression searches.
</p>

<p>
To start generating Search URLs using this application, you will want to click on the "Create Search" button.
After creating an expression and clicking "Done", you can create multi-expression searches by clicking the "+" button to add more.
</p>

<p>
For example, to search for all Analgesics, you would use one expression:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Category equals Analgesics</li>
</ul>

<p>
Whereas, to search for all Analgesics within the Drug Information Portal, you would use two expressions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Category equals Analgesics</li>
<li>Locator equals DrugPortal</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you instead wanted to find all Analgesics not within the Drug Information Portal, you would check the "NOT" box on that expression:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Category equals Analgesics</li>
<li>NOT Locator equals DrugPortal</li>
</ul>

<p>
After entering the expression(s) and clicking "Get Results", the browser navigates to the HTML view of the results.
To investigate the API Search URLs and JSON results for this search, click the "VIEW" button on the top right and select JSON.
You will then see two API Search URL links and two JSON results.
The top section is for Totals; the URL includes data=totals and thus only returns the count of matching substances.
</p>

<p>
Then the next section is for all the per-substance data types.
The default data parameter is data=summary.
You can also use the "Data Parameter Choice" button to select any of the other data parameters instead.
The JSON results for the selected parameter are listed below that.
</p>

<p>
An alternative to using this ChemID<i>plus</i> API Search is the Swagger UI.
This includes more machine-readable information and is available at <a href="https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/api/swagger-ui.html" target="_blank">https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/api/swagger-ui.html</a>.
However, it does not include details about how to generate valid multi-expression searches.
