<p>
There are 2 user interfaces to help you learn to build valid ChemID<i>plus</i> API Search URLs: this application and the Swagger UI.
We expect this ChemID<i>plus</i> API Search application will be more useful for most users, especially for building multi-expression searches.
</p>

<p>
Click the <span class="top-menu-button">Help</span> button above to read how to create and edit both single- and multi-expression searches.
</p>

<p>
After entering expression(s) and clicking the <span class="go-button">Get Results</span> button, the browser navigates to the HTML view of the results.
To investigate the API Search URLs and JSON results for any search, click the <span class="outline-primary-button">VIEW</span> button on the top right and select "JSON".
You will then see two API Search URL links and two JSON results.
The top section is for Totals; the URL includes data=totals and thus only returns the count of matching substances.
</p>

<p>
Then the next section is for all the per-substance data types.
The default data parameter is data=summary.
You can also use the <span class="outline-primary-button">Data Parameter Choice</span> button to select any of the other data parameters instead.
The JSON results for the selected parameter are listed below that.
</p>

<p>
An alternative to using this ChemID<i>plus</i> API Search is the Swagger UI.
This includes more machine-readable information and is available at <a href="https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/api/swagger-ui.html" target="_blank">https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/api/swagger-ui.html</a>.
However, it does not include details about how to generate valid multi-expression searches.
